The sound of this 24-voice polyphonic beast will take you from your studio right to Valhalla. Earth shattering basses, exquisite leads or outer-worldly FX, Odin's got them all! Use the classic sound of analog waveforms - or draw your own. High quality emulations of legendary analog filters like the Moog-ladder or the Korg-35 further shape your signal. Round your sound off with five onboard FX, or get crazy with modulation. There's much to discover in Odin 2.

The design approach of Odin 2 lets you choose from a large variety of modules, which can be mixed and matched for virtually endless sonic capabilities. Three Oscillators, three Filters, a dedicated Distortion, four onboard FX, four Envelopes, four LFOs ... the list continues: Modulate tons of parameters with the big-ass Modulation Matrix, use the Arpeggiator and Step Sequencer to generate rhythms and musical ideas, theres Unison, a XY-Pad, you can draw your oscillator waves, or maybe your spectra?
