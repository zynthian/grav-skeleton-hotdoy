JC303 is Bass Synthesizer Audio Plugin, clone of Roland TB-303. This project is a JUCE port of Robin Schmidt’s Open303 DSP engine, with a mission to make Open303 accessible across different platforms and plugin formats. Our goal is to provide musicians and producers with a seamless experience to harness the incredible power of the Open303 DSP engine.

##About Open303

Open303 embodies the essence of open source development. It all began when Robin Schmidt called upon a community of passionate individuals to embark on the quest for the ultimate TB-303 clone on the KVRAudio forum. [Read the Forum Post](https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=262829).

Over the span of a decade, enthusiasts dived deep into their oscilloscopes, engaged in circuit reverse engineering analyses, and passionately debated the inner workings of our beloved TB-303. The result? The finest emulation of the TB-303 ever created, and it’s open source! Achieving high-quality Virtual Analog (VA) filters in the DSP realm is notoriously challenging, but Open303 conquers this frontier with excellence.
