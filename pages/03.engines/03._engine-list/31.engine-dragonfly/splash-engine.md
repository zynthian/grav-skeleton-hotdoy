Dragonfly Reverb is a bundle of free audio effect plugins (LV2 and VST) for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

**Dragonfly Hall Reverb** is a free stereo-to-stereo reverb effect. It is primarily intended for use as a concert hall reverb. It also has numerous smaller presets representing rooms, studios, and chambers. It is based on Hibiki Reverb from Freeverb3VST, which uses Moorer's early reflection model and a modified FDN allpass Zita reverb.

**Dragonfly Room Reverb** is a free stereo-to-stereo reverb effect. It has several different room presets, as well as a small number of hall presets and effect presets. It is based on ProG Reverb from Freeverb3VST, which uses Moorer's early reflection model and an implementation of Jon Dattorro's Progenitor Reverb algorithm. 

**Dragonfly Plate** is a free mono-to-stereo reverb plugin based on NVerb and STRev from Freeverb3 VST.

**Dragonfly Early Reflections** is a free stereo-to-stereo reverb effect based on Moorer's early reflection model as implemented in Freeverb3 VST. This is the same algorithm used in Dragonfly Hall and Dragonfly Room, but without any late reverberation algorithm.
